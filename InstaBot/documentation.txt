Usage:
- Set your Instagram username and password in the script.
- Set the CSV file name containing the post information.
- Format the CSV file as follows:
    image, theme, post_time
    (image: image file name, theme: theme of the post, post_time: time in the format "HH:MM")
- Run the script using `python3 instagram_auto_poster.py`
